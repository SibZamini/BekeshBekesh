/*
This package introduces a simple localization layer that can be used by a templating engine.

Upon retrieving a localization package, values can be retrieved in both Go code and
the .html files via Get(key string). If a given key hasn't been translated, the
default localization pack will be accessed.

If the templating engine accesses non existent values, the server will panic.
This makes sure that we can't oversee the use of non-existent values.

Values must be plain text and not contain any HTML or CSS.
If values are to be inserted dynamically, placeholders can be placed with "%s".
